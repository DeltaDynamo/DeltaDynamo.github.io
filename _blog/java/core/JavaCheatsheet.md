## Key Java Terms and Concepts

> **Official Docs** : [Oracle Docs for Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)

---

#### ‚úÖ 1. [Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html)

> An `interface` in Java defines a **contract** ‚Äî a set of method signatures ‚Äî that implementing classes must follow. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces do **not have instance fields or constructors**, and they are used to achieve **100% abstraction** (in older Java) and **multiple inheritance of type**.
>
> From **Java 8**, interfaces can also include **default** and **static** methods with implementations.
> From **Java 9**, they can include **private methods**.

---

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void drive(); // abstract method
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car...");
    }
}
```

**Java 8+ features**:

```java
interface Calculator {
    default int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    private void log() {
        System.out.println("Private helper");
    }
}
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Use to **enforce contracts** across unrelated classes (e.g., `Car`, `Boat`, `Drone` can all implement `Vehicle`).
* Useful when we want to **separate what a class should do** from **how it does it**.
* Common in **API design**, **plug-in systems**, and **event handling**.
* Interfaces enable **multiple inheritance of behavior** (Java classes can implement multiple interfaces).
* All methods are `public abstract` by default unless marked `default`, `static`, or `private`.
* A class must implement **all abstract methods** of the interface **if it's a concrete class**.
* **Cannot create objects** from interfaces.
* Interfaces **cannot have constructors** or instance fields (can have static `final` constants).

**Since**: Java 1.0

**Memory/Performance**:

* No memory overhead unless methods are used.
* Default methods can be overridden, static methods cannot.

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. [Abstract Class and Abstract Method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html)

> An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It acts as a blueprint or foundation for other classes to build upon. We should think of it as an incomplete class meant to be extended by subclasses that will provide the full implementation.
>
> Abstract classes are used when we want to define some common behavior (shared logic) while leaving other behavior to be customized by individual subclasses.
>
> Within an abstract class, we can declare abstract methods ‚Äî these are method declarations without any body. In other words, they only specify the method signature, and it‚Äôs the responsibility of the *first concrete (non-abstract)* subclasses to implement the actual method logic.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method

    void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Breathing...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Use when multiple related classes **share some code** but must implement specific behaviors differently.
* Abstract classes help enforce a **common base contract** while allowing **partial implementation**.
* Ideal when behavior is shared but object creation should only be allowed via concrete subclasses.
* Can contain **constructors**, **fields**, and **non-abstract methods**.
* Abstract methods **must be implemented** by the first non-abstract subclass.
* Cannot be marked `final` (must allow inheritance).
* A class becomes abstract if it contains at least one abstract method.


**Since**: Java 1.0

**Memory/Performance**:

* No special memory cost compared to regular classes.
* Abstract methods incur **polymorphic dispatch (runtime overriding)**, like regular overridden methods.

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Functional Interface**

> A functional interface is an interface that contains **exactly one abstract method**. It is used as the **target type for lambda expressions** and method references. Functional interfaces may also contain **default**, **static**, and **private methods**, but only one abstract method is allowed.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter<T, R> {
    R convert(T input);
}

Converter<String, Integer> toInteger = str -> Integer.parseInt(str);
System.out.println(toInteger.convert("42")); // Output: 42
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Used heavily in **Java 8+ features** like **Lambdas**, **Streams**, and **method references**
* The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is **optional** but helps catch violations at compile-time
* Can extend another functional interface if it doesn't introduce additional abstract methods
* If more than one abstract method is present, it **fails to compile**
* Common built-in functional interfaces: `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Predicate`, `Supplier`

**Since**: Java 8

**Memory/Performance**:

* Lambda expressions using functional interfaces are compiled to **invokedynamic** bytecode
* Efficient and faster than anonymous inner classes due to reduced object allocation and bytecode size

---

#### ‚úÖ 4. [Generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html)

> Generics provide **compile-time type safety** and eliminate the need for casting by allowing classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on **typed parameters** (e.g., `List<String>`). They enable **code reusability** with different data types while preserving strong type checking.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
class Box<T> {
    private T value;
    public void set(T value) { this.value = value; }
    public T get() { return value; }
}

Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.set("Hello");
String msg = stringBox.get(); // No casting needed
```

**Usage & Caveats**:


* Commonly used in **collections** like `List<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, and utility methods
* **Eliminates ClassCastException** at runtime by enforcing types at compile time
* Supports **bounded types** using `extends` (upper bound) or `super` (lower bound) (more about this in box below)
* **Type erasure** removes generic type info at runtime ‚Äî no access to type parameter with reflection
* Cannot create instances of generic types (`new T()` not allowed)
* Cannot use primitives directly (`List<int>` is invalid; use `List<Integer>`)
* Supports **wildcards** (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible APIs

**Since**: Java 5

**Memory/Performance**:

* No extra runtime cost ‚Äî generics use **type erasure**, so compiled bytecode is similar to raw types
* Improves performance by avoiding **unnecessary casting and boxing** in collections

```markdown

In Java Generics, we can **restrict the types** that can be used as type parameters using **bounded types** ‚Äî this is done with `extends` (for upper bounds) and `super` (for lower bounds). These are mainly used in **wildcards**, but also in generic class or method declarations.

**Upper Bound (`extends`)**

Use when wanting to **accept a type or its subclasses**.
---
class Box<T extends Number> {  // T must be Number or a subclass
    T value;
}
---

With wildcards:
---
void printNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) {
    for (Number n : list) {
        System.out.println(n);
    }
}
---
* Accepts `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, `List<Number>`
* **Can't add** to the list (except `null`), but **can read** safely as `Number`

**Lower Bound (`super`)**

Use when wanting to **accept a type or its superclasses**.
---
void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    list.add(10);  // Valid
}
---
* Accepts `List<Integer>`, `List<Number>`, `List<Object>`
* **Can add** `Integer` values, but **can't read** specific types (only as `Object`)


**Mnemonic**:
* `extends` ‚Üí read-only
* `super` ‚Üí write-only
  (Think: **PECS** ‚Äì Producer Extends, Consumer Super)
```

---

#### ‚úÖ 5. `static` keyword

> The static keyword is used to define class-level members - i.e. fields, methods, blocks, and nested classes. These members are shared across all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an object. Static members belong to the class itself, not to any particular instance.

**Example 1. Static Field**

A static field is shared by all instances of a class. It‚Äôs typically used for constants or to maintain class-level state.

```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // shared across all instances

    Counter() {
        count++; // increments shared count
    }
}
```

* Accessed using class name: `Counter.count`
* Useful for constants or counters.
* Memory is allocated once in the class loading phase.

**Example 2. Static Method**

> A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object. It cannot access instance variables or methods directly.

```java
class MathUtils {
    static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
}
```

* Called like: `MathUtils.square(5)`
* Can only access other static members directly.
* Often used for utility methods (e.g., `Collections.sort()`, `Math.max()`).

| üîç **Why static methods can't access non-static members**                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚Ä¢ Static methods do not have access to `this`.                                                                                           |
| ‚Ä¢ Non-static fields and methods need an object to exist, so they need `this` reference.                                                  |
| ‚Ä¢ Since static methods are not tied to any particular object, there's no way to know which object's non-static member we want to access. |
| ‚Ä¢ This preserves a clear boundary between class-level logic and object-level data.                                                       |


**Example 3. Static Block**

> A static block runs **once** when the class is loaded by the JVM. It's used to initialize static variables or perform setup logic.

```java
class Config {
    static String DB_URL;

    static {
        DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost";
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }
}
```

* Executes once when the class is first loaded (even before `main()`).
* Cannot be inside methods or constructors.
* Multiple static blocks are allowed and run **in order of appearance**.
* Used for loading config, initializing static resources, or registering drivers.

**Example 4. Static Nested Class**

> A static class declared inside another class does not require an instance of the outer class.

```java
class Outer {
    static class Nested {
        void greet() {
            System.out.println("Hello from static nested class");
        }
    }
}
```

* Accessed like: `Outer.Nested nested = new Outer.Nested();`
* Cannot access non-static members of the outer class.
* Often used to group helper classes.

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Static fields are memory-efficient and shared globally, but care is needed in multithreaded environments.
* Static methods can't access `this` or instance members directly.
* Static blocks help in initializing static state, but must be short and predictable.
* Static methods are not polymorphic [(they support **method hiding**, not overriding)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html).
* Overusing static can lead to **tight coupling** and reduce testability.
* Static classes are commonly used in enums, utility libraries, and singleton patterns.

**Since**: Java 1.0

**Memory/Performance**:

* Static members are stored in **method area** (not heap).
* Fast access, low memory footprint when used properly.
* Can create bottlenecks if static fields are **mutable and shared across threads**.

---

#### ‚úÖ 6. `final` keyword

> The `final` keyword is used to indicate that something **cannot be changed**. It can apply to variables (cannot be reassigned), methods (cannot be overridden), and classes (cannot be extended).

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
final class Constants {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;
}

final int x = 10;
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* For variables: ensures **immutability of reference**, not necessarily object contents
* For methods: prevents overriding in subclasses, used for **security and stability**
* For classes: prevents inheritance (e.g., `String`, `Math` are final)
* Final fields must be **initialized once**, either at declaration or in the constructor
* Final does **not mean immutable** for object references; it just means the reference can't change

---

#### ‚úÖ 7. `super` keyword

> Refers to the parent class of the current object and is used to call superclass methods or constructors.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
class Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Animal"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void speak() {
        super.speak();  // Calls Animal's speak()
        System.out.println("Dog");
    }
}
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Used to access overridden methods, parent constructors, or hidden fields
* Must be the first statement in a constructor if calling a superclass constructor

---

#### ‚úÖ 8. Default Methods in Interface

> A `default` method in an interface allows us to provide a **concrete method implementation** inside the interface itself. It was introduced in Java 8 to support **interface evolution** without breaking existing implementations.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting vehicle...");
    }
}
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Lets interfaces have **method bodies**, unlike in earlier Java versions.
* Allows **adding new functionality** to interfaces without breaking existing classes.
* Can be **overridden** by implementing classes.
* A class implementing multiple interfaces with conflicting default methods must **override the method** to resolve the conflict.
* Not allowed in classes ‚Äî `default` is only for interface methods.
* Cannot be `abstract`, `static`, or `final`.

**Memory/Performance**:

* No runtime overhead ‚Äî compiled just like regular instance methods.
* Enables backward-compatible evolution of APIs (like Java Collections).

---

#### ‚úÖ 9. Optional

> `Optional<T>` is a **container object** introduced in Java 8 to represent the **presence or absence of a non-null value**. It helps eliminate explicit `null` checks and reduces the chances of `NullPointerException`.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.of("Hello!");
name.ifPresent(n -> System.out.println(n));  // prints "Hello!"

Optional<String> empty = Optional.empty();
System.out.println(empty.orElse("Default")); // prints "Default"
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Use `Optional` as a **return type**, not for fields or method parameters.
* Avoids verbose `null` checks with methods like `isPresent()`, `ifPresent()`, `orElse()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `filter()`.
* `Optional.of()` throws if value is null; use `Optional.ofNullable()` for null-safe wrapping.
* Not meant to replace all nulls ‚Äî use where it **adds semantic meaning**.
* Do **not use in collections or serialization-heavy code** (adds overhead).
* Helps encourage **functional-style programming** and better **null safety**.

**Memory/Performance**:

* Slightly more memory than plain reference due to wrapper object.
* Eliminates many `NullPointerException`s at runtime by making **null handling explicit**.

---

#### ‚úÖ 10. Annotations

> Annotations are **metadata markers** that provide information to the compiler, tools, or runtime. They do not change the actual logic but can influence behavior via frameworks, tools, or the Java compiler.

**Syntax & Example**:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Example";
}

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public void method() { }

@Deprecated
void oldMethod() {}
```

**Usage & Caveats**:

* Used for **compiler checks**, **code generation**, **dependency injection**, **configuration**, etc.
* Built-in annotations: `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, `@SuppressWarnings`, `@FunctionalInterface`, `@SafeVarargs`, etc.
* Custom annotations can be defined using `@interface` and may include elements (fields).
* Often used with frameworks (e.g., Spring, JUnit, Hibernate) for **declarative programming**.
* Can be retained at **source**, **class**, or **runtime** levels using `@Retention`.
* `@Target` controls where annotation can be applied (e.g., method, field, class).
* Reflection (`AnnotatedElement`) is required to read runtime annotations.
* Overuse can make code harder to read; best used where **declarative config** is clearer than imperative code.

**Since**: Java 5 (enhanced usage in Java 8+ with repeated and type annotations)

**Memory/Performance**:

* Negligible memory impact.
* Runtime annotations may slightly affect performance if used heavily with reflection.
