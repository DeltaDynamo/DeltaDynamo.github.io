### 1.1 Core Generative AI Concepts and Use Cases

#### 🔹 Core Concepts

> * **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** → Broad field of computer science focused on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence (learning, problem-solving, decision-making etc.).

> * **Machine Learning (ML)** → A subset of AI where algorithms learn from data patterns and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed for task.

> * **Deep Learning (DL)** → A subset of ML using large neural networks with many layers (inspired by structure of human brain), allowing the model to handle unstructured data like images, speech, and text.

> * **Generative AI (GenAI)** → A specific application of ML which focuses on generating new content (text, audio, images, video, code) that resembles human-created content.

> * **Foundation Models** → Very large, pre-trained models built on massive datasets, designed to be adapted for many downstream tasks (general-purpose).

> * **Large Language Models (LLMs)** → Foundation models specialized for understanding, processing and generating human language; trained on huge amounts of text data for tasks like summarization, Q\&A, and code generation.

> * **Multimodal Foundation Models** → Models that process multiple types of input/output (e.g., text + images, text + audio), making them more flexible in real-world tasks.

> * **Diffusion Models** → Generative models that learn by progressively denoising data from random noise to produce realistic high quality images.

> * **Prompt Engineering** → Crafting and refining input prompts to guide LLMs toward producing high-quality, relevant, and accurate responses.

---

#### 🔹 Machine Learning Approaches

> * **Supervised Learning** → Trains models on labeled datasets (input + correct output). Example: training spam filters with emails marked “spam” or “not spam.”

> * **Unsupervised Learning** → Works with unlabeled data to find patterns, clusters, or anomalies. Example: customer segmentation in marketing without predefined categories.

> * **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** → Models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties. Example: game-playing agents (like AlphaGo) or Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for LLM alignment.

---

#### 🔹 ML Lifecycle

1. **Data Ingestion & Preparation** → Collect raw data from multiple sources (databases, sensors, logs, APIs). Clean, preprocess, and annotate data; address missing values, duplicates, or imbalances.
2. **Model Training** → Train ML/GenAI models on prepared data, adjusting weights using algorithms like gradient descent.
3. **Model Evaluation** → Once trained, models performance is evaluated using unseen data to make sure it meets accuracy requirements.
4. **Model Deployment** → Make the trained model available for real-world use through APIs or integrated systems.
5. **Model Management & Monitoring** → Monitor accuracy, retrain periodically, ensure fairness, and manage model versions for reliability.


---

#### 🔹 Business Use Cases of GenAI

* **Create** → Generate blog posts, marketing copy, product designs, code snippets, or even videos.
* **Summarize** → Reduce long documents, meeting transcripts, or research papers into concise, digestible summaries.
* **Discover** → Analyze complex datasets to find insights (e.g., trend detection in customer feedback).
* **Automate** → Power chatbots, virtual assistants, fraud detection systems, or personalized recommendation engines.

---

### 1.2 Data in Generative AI and Business Implications

* **Data Quality** → High-quality data is ***accurate, complete, consistent, and relevant***. Poor quality introduces bias, reduces reliability, and may result in harmful AI outcomes.
* **Data Accessibility** → Businesses must ensure data is easy to access in the right format, while maintaining governance and security. This speeds up AI adoption and reduces development costs.
* **Structured Data** → Organized data stored in fixed formats like databases or spreadsheets. Example: customer purchase history, financial records.
* **Unstructured Data** → Free-form data without a predefined schema. Example: emails, videos, PDFs, social media posts. Most real-world data is unstructured.
* **Labeled Data** → Annotated with correct answers (e.g., image labeled “dog”). Essential for supervised learning and high accuracy tasks.
* **Unlabeled Data** → Raw, unannotated data. Used in unsupervised or self-supervised learning. More abundant but harder to train directly.

### 3.2 Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### 3.2.1 What is Prompt Engineering?

* Designing **inputs (prompts)** to get reliable outputs from LLMs.

#### 3.2.2 Core Prompting Techniques

* **Zero-shot** → No examples.
  *Example*: “Summarize this blog in 3 bullet points.”
* **One-shot** → One example.
  *Example*: “Translate Cat → Chat. Now Dog → ?”
* **Few-shot** → Multiple examples.
  *Example*: Showing 3 solved math problems before giving a new one.
* **Role prompting** → Assign context.
  *Example*: “You are a fitness coach. Suggest a 7-day workout.”
* **Prompt chaining** → Step-by-step tasks.
  *Example*: First summarize an article → then create quiz questions.

#### 3.2.3 Advanced Prompting Techniques

* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** → Encourages the model to **reason step by step**, breaking down complex problems into smaller logical parts before reaching the final solution.
  *Example*: *“Show your reasoning step by step before giving the final answer to this math problem.”*
  
  > ✅ Benefits for Business Leaders:

  > Transparency & Trust → Leaders get visibility into how the AI reached a conclusion, which builds confidence in business-critical decisions (e.g., financial forecasting, compliance checks).

  > Error Reduction → By breaking problems into smaller steps, CoT lowers the risk of incorrect or “hallucinated” answers.

  > Training & Knowledge Transfer → Useful in scenarios like onboarding or employee support, where step-by-step explanations help teams learn and understand.

* **ReAct (Reason + Act) Prompting** → Combines **reasoning with external actions**. The model reasons about the problem, decides what information it needs, retrieves it using external tools or APIs, and then uses that information to refine its response.
  *Example*: *“Look up the current weather in Paris, then summarize it in one sentence.”*

  > ✅ Benefits for Business Leaders:

  > Up-to-Date Insights → AI can pull the latest business data, market news, or compliance updates, ensuring decisions are based on current information.

  > Operational Efficiency → Automates complex workflows by reasoning and fetching data in real time (e.g., supply chain assistant checking stock levels and suggesting alternatives).

  > Scalable Decision Support → Reduces reliance on manual research, freeing teams to focus on strategy instead of repetitive tasks.


#### 3.2.4 Miscellaneous Techniques in Prompting

**🔄 Reusing Prompts in Gemini** allows us to save and apply effective prompts again without rewriting them each time. This helps ensure consistency, reduce effort, and speed up workflows — for example, a leader can reuse a prompt for drafting standardized customer responses across different teams.

**💾 Saved Info in Gemini** lets us store important details, such as facts, preferences, or company-specific context, so that Gemini can use them in future conversations. This ensures the model’s responses stay accurate and aligned with organizational needs, like automatically following brand guidelines when generating content.

**💎 Gems in Gemini** are specialized, customizable AI agents built on top of Gemini to handle specific workflows or business tasks. They act like dedicated copilots for functions such as HR, sales, or support — for instance, a Gem could summarize client calls, prepare proposals, and draft follow-up emails for a sales team.

### 3.3 Grounding Techniques & Use Cases

#### 3.3.1 What is Grounding?

* Anchoring outputs to **trusted real-world data**.

#### 3.3.2 Types of Grounding

* **First-party data** → Company docs.
  *Example*: Banking chatbot using internal policy PDFs.
* **Third-party data** → Licensed datasets.
  *Example*: Healthcare AI using licensed medical databases.
* **World data** → Public web sources.
  *Example*: Travel assistant checking Google Search for latest flight delays.

#### 3.3.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique where the model doesn’t rely only on what it was trained on, *but first retrieves the most relevant, up-to-date information from a trusted source (like a database, knowledge base, or documents). This retrieved context is then combined with the model’s reasoning to generate a more accurate and reliable response*.

**⚙️ Process**: The system searches for relevant documents → feeds that content into the model as additional context → the model uses both its training and the retrieved data to generate the final output.

**💡 Example**: An e-commerce chatbot using RAG can look up the latest product details (like stock, price, or specifications) from the company’s database before answering a customer, ensuring the response is accurate and grounded in real business data.

#### 3.3.4 Google Cloud Grounding Offerings

* **Prebuilt RAG in Vertex AI Search** → Out-of-the-box enterprise Q\&A.
  *Example*: Employee portal search assistant.
* **RAG APIs** → Custom workflows.
  *Example*: Building a legal document search system.
* **Grounding with Google Search** → Adds web knowledge.
  *Example*: News summarizer with real-time updates.

  *Example*: Short vs. long summaries of a news article.
* **Temperature** → Randomness:

  * *Low (0.2)* → Precise answer.
  * *High (0.8)* → Creative answer.
    *Example*: Low temp = factual “What is 2+2?”, high temp = creative poem.
* **Top-p (nucleus sampling)** → Balance creativity with coherence.
  *Example*: Story generation with realistic but diverse options.
* **Safety settings** → Prevent unsafe outputs.
  *Example*: Blocking harmful or toxic answers in a customer chatbot.

### 🔑 3.5 Key Differences in Gen AI Concepts

| **Concept A**                | **Concept B**                            | **Difference (Exam-Relevant)**                                                                                                                                                                | **Example**                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fine-tuning**              | **Grounding (RAG / external data)**      | Fine-tuning permanently adjusts the model weights using **specialized training data**. Grounding does **not change the model**; it just provides external context during inference.           | Fine-tuning a model on medical data vs. grounding a model with hospital FAQ at runtime.          |
| **Temperature**              | **Top-p (nucleus sampling)**             | Temperature controls **randomness globally** (higher = more creative, lower = more deterministic). Top-p limits sampling to the **top % of likely tokens** → balances coherence with variety. | Temperature=0.8 → creative story. Top-p=0.9 → only pick from top 90% likely words.               |
| **Zero-shot prompting**      | **Few-shot prompting**                   | Zero-shot: no examples, model relies only on training. Few-shot: multiple examples provided in prompt to guide output.                                                                        | Zero-shot: “Translate cat to French.” Few-shot: Provide 3 translations before asking a new one.  |
| **Bias**                     | **Hallucination**                        | Bias = systematic unfairness in outputs due to training data. Hallucination = model generating factually incorrect but plausible-sounding content.                                            | Bias: AI suggests only male candidates for a job. Hallucination: AI cites a fake research paper. |
| **Knowledge cutoff**         | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Knowledge cutoff = model can’t know anything beyond last training date. RAG = way to **inject up-to-date info** at inference.                                                                 | Cutoff = can’t answer 2024 elections. RAG = fetch election results and answer correctly.         |
| **Prompt chaining**          | **Chain-of-thought prompting**           | Prompt chaining = split task into multiple steps with multiple prompts. Chain-of-thought = force model to show reasoning in a **single prompt**.                                              | Chaining: summarize → then quiz → then explain. CoT: “Solve math step by step.”                  |
| **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)** | **Fully automated inference**            | HITL = humans review/approve outputs before use. Fully automated = AI outputs go directly to production.                                                                                      | HITL: AI drafts a contract → lawyer reviews. Automated: chatbot replies instantly.               |

### 3.6 Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering (with RAG)

| Aspect              | **Fine-Tuning**                                                                                                         | **Prompt Engineering (with RAG)**                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Customizing a pre-trained model by training it further on domain-specific labeled data.                                 | Designing effective prompts and optionally using **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to inject external context at runtime. |
| **Data Needs**      | Requires large, high-quality labeled datasets for the specific domain.                                                  | Works with existing model, needs minimal/no training data — just relevant documents or knowledge base.                           |
| **Cost & Effort**   | High (training infrastructure, labeled data, ongoing maintenance).                                                      | Low (iterative prompt design + connecting to data sources).                                                                      |
| **Flexibility**     | Fixed after training — updating requires retraining.                                                                    | Highly flexible — just update prompts or refresh the retrieved data.                                                             |
| **Output Behavior** | Model “learns” domain style, terminology, and facts permanently.                                                        | Model adapts dynamically using prompts + retrieved context, without changing core weights.                                       |
| **Best For**        | When consistent, domain-specific responses are needed (e.g., a medical assistant using highly specialized terminology). | When responses must stay **up-to-date** or **context-aware** (e.g., customer support bot retrieving latest order details).       |
| **Example**         | Fine-tuning GPT/Gemini with thousands of legal documents to act as a legal assistant.                                   | Using RAG to retrieve case law from a legal database on demand and guiding the model via prompts.                                |


#### 3.6.1 When to Use Each

* **Use Fine-Tuning when:**

  * The business has **specialized vocabulary, tone, or format** that the base model doesn’t handle well.
  * We want **consistent, domain-specific behavior** (e.g., compliance, medical, legal, financial reporting).

* **Use Prompt Engineering + RAG when:**

  * We need **real-time, factual updates** from external data sources (inventory, policies, news).
  * We want flexibility without costly retraining.
  * Use cases involve **question answering, search assistants, knowledge retrieval**.
